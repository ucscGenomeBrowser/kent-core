flow reverseRange(int oldStart,int oldEnd,int seqSize) into (int newStart,int newEnd)
// Flow function have no side effects.  The compiler checks this.
// Flow functions can read from anywhere, but can only write to
// local variables and their output.   Calls to "flow" functions are 
// allowed  inside of para statements, while calls to "to"
// functions are not.

    newStart = seqSize - oldEnd;

    }

// The actual parallelism is done via the "para" construct.  The
// general form of this construct is:
//      para (element in collection) action expression
// where collection is something like an array or dir,
// element is a variable that refers to something in the
// collection, and action is a key word such as 'do' 'get', 'add', 'max'
// 'filter', etc.

// Most para actions return a result.  The following example
// sums up all the elements in an array.
     int sum = para (i in a) + i;

// This example creates a new array containing only the even numbers
// in an larger array
     array of int evens = para (i in a) filter a%2 == 0;

// This creates a table of sine values indexed by degrees, assuming that
// the sin() math library function takes radians.  In general the para
// action get returns a collection of the same type and size as the
// input collection.
     array of double sinLookup = para (i in 0 to 360) get math.sin(i*2*math.pi/360);

// Other para actions include 
//     multiply - returns the product of all expressions
//     min - returns the smallest expression
//     max - returns the largest
//     argmin -  returns the index of the element that produced the smallest 
//           expression.   If the collection is an array then the index is of 
//           type long,  if the collection is a dir then the index is a string.
//     argmax - returns the index  of the element producing largest expression.

// The 'do' action does not produce a value.  It can be used to change
// the values of the items in the collection.  A 'do' action is followed
// by a statement rather than an expression.  The statement can be 
// compound. Here's an example of a para statement that squares every member
// of an array:
     array of int a = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10);
     para (i in a do)
         i = i*i;

// Within a para do statement only the  element, and any 
// local variables declared within the statement
// may be modified.  When the element is modified, the corresponding
// value in the collection is updated.



/* ParaFlow is object oriented, but not in your face about it.
 * It does not support multiple inheritance.  It does support
 * interfaces.  Built in types include: byte (8 bits), short (16 bits),
 * int (32 bits), long (64 bits), float (double-precision IEEE), 
 * string (arbitrarily long), files, array, list (internally a doubly-linked list),
 * dir (internally a hash table), and tree (internally a self-balancing red-black tree).
 * Arrays, lists, and catalogs all implement the collection interface.
 * Anything that implements this interface can be used in para functions,
 * and for statements. */
