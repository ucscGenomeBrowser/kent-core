This directory contains three programs for doing In-Silico PCR:
   webPcr - Web CGI script which queries gfServer to perform PCR.
   gfPcr - Command line program which queries gfServer to perform PCR.
   isPcr - Command line program that builds its own index (rather than
       relying on gfServer) to do PCR.  This uses a lot of memory and
       is best done one chromosome at a time in batch mode, ideally on
       a cluster of machines.
