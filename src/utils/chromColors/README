The definition for the palette is taken directly from the
source tree: ../../hg/inc/chromColors.h

The PERL script hToTxt.pl will read that chromColors.h
file and create a palette.txt file.

The PERL script paletteToHtml.pl will read that palette.txt
file to create a sample HTML page: palette.html

Finally, hexToPng.pl reads the palette.txt file, then uses
ImageMagick commands to draw the color bar used on
the browser.

The ImageMagick programs in hexToPng.pl expect to be able
to interact with an X server.  A blank drawing surface
is created by a grab of the X server screen.  That drawing
surface is then drawn into with "convert" commands.
