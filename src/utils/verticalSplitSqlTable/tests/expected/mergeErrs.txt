ATF2		ATF2 is a stress inducible basic leucine zipper transcription factor from the CREB family.  ATF2 is phosphorylated at threonine residues 69 and 71 by JNK or p38 mitogen activated protein kinases.  Mutation of these residues leads to the loss of ATF2 transactivation in vitro.

ATF2		ATF2 is a bZip transcription factor from the CREB family.  ATF2 binds to both cAMP response elements (TGACGTCA) and TPA responsive element (TGAGTCA) and is known to heterodimerize with JUN members of the AP1 family of transcription factors. ATF2 is activated by phosphorylation of Thr71 by the stress activated p38 mitogen activated protein kinases.	GeneCard:ATF2	http://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=ATF2
ATF2		This gene encodes a transcription factor that is a member of the leucine zipper family of DNA binding proteins. This protein binds to the cAMP-responsive element (CRE), an octameric palindrome. The protein forms a homodimer or heterodimer with c-Jun and stimulates CRE-dependent transcription. The protein is also a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) that specifically acetylates histones H2B and H4 in vitro; thus it may represent a class of sequence-specific factors that activate transcription by direct effects on chromatin components. Additional transcript variants have been identified but their biological validity has not been determined. (provided by RefSeq)	GeneCard:ATF2	http://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=ATF2

BCL11A		This gene encodes a C2H2 type zinc-finger protein by its similarity to the mouse Bcl11a/Evi9 protein. The corresponding mouse gene is a common site of retroviral integration in myeloid leukemia, and may function as a leukemia disease gene, in part, through its interaction with BCL6. During hematopoietic cell differentiation, this gene is down-regulated. It is possibly involved in lymphoma pathogenesis since translocations associated with B-cell malignancies also deregulates its expression. Multiple transcript variants encoding several different isoforms have been found for this gene. (provided by RefSeq)	GeneCard:BCL11A	http://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=BCL11A
