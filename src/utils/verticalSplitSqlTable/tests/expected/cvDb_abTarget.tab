GATA1		GATA-1 is a transcriptional activator which probably serves as a general switch factor for erythroid development. It binds to DNA sites with the consensus sequence [AT]GATA[AG} within regulatory regions of globin genes and of other genes expressed in erythroid cells.

GATA3		This gene encodes a protein which belongs to the GATA family of transcription factors.  The protein contains two GATA-type zinc fingers and is a n important regulator of T-cell development and plays an important role in endothelial cell biology.  Defects in this gene are the cause of hypoparathyroidism with sensorineural deafness and renal dysplasia (provided by RefSeq).	GeneCard:GATA3	http://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=GATA3
GCN5		KAT2A, or GCN5, is a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) that functions primarily as a transcriptional activator. Acetylation of histones gives a specific tag for epigenetic transcription activation. In case of HIV-1 infection, it is recruited by the viral protein Tat. Regulates Tat's transactivating activity and may help inducing chromatin remodeling of proviral genes. Component of the SAGA and ATAC complexes, complexes with histone acetyltransferase activities on histones H3 and H4	GeneCard:KAT2A	http://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=KAT2A&search=gcn5
GR		Glucocorticoid Receptor	GeneCard:NR3C1	http://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=NR3C1
