E2F family members play a crucial role in control of the cell cycle and of the action of tumor suppressor proteins. They are also a target of the transforming proteins of small DNA tumor viruses. Many E2F proteins contain several evolutionarily conserved domains: a DNA binding domain, a dimerization domain which determines interaction with the differentiation regulated transcription factor proteins (DP), a transactivation domain enriched in acidic amino acids, and a tumor suppressor protein association domain which is embedded within the transactivation domain. The encoded protein of this gene is atypical because it lacks the transactivation and tumor suppressor protein association domains. It contains a modular suppression domain and is an inhibitor of E2F-dependent transcription. The protein is part of a multimeric protein complex that contains a histone methyltransferase and the transcription factors Mga and Max. Multiple transcript variants have been reported for this gene, but it has not been clearly demonstrated that they encode valid isoforms (RefSeq).

Egr-1 binds to the DNA sequence 5'-CGCCCCCGC-3' (EGR-site), there- by activating transcription of target genes whose products are required for mitogenisis and differentiation. Egr-2 binds specific DNA sites located in the promoter region of HoxA4. Egr-2 defects cause congenital hypomyelination neuropathy (also designated Charcot-Marie-tooth disease) and Dejerine- Sottas neuropathology (also designated hereditary motor and sensory neuro- pathy III.

Antibody Target: GCN5	KAT2A, or GCN5, is a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) that functions primarily as a transcriptional activator. Acetylation of histones gives a specific tag for epigenetic transcription activation. In case of HIV-1 infection, it is recruited by the viral protein Tat. Regulates Tat's transactivating activity and may help inducing chromatin remodeling of proviral genes.
