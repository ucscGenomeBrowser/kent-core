How did we make the tables:
// generate iso-8859-1 text table:
int i;
for(i=128;i<256;++i)
    {
    printf("%2x ", i);
    putc(i, stdout);
    printf("\n");
    }

galtFixUtf8Chars find db hgcentraltest gbMembers userName > win1252.text

Because the 1252 has just 6 holes in it, iconv was pedantic,
and I had to add -c which skipped the output leaving the field blank.

cat win1252.text | iconv -f windows-1252 -t utf-8 -c > utf8.text

The utility depends on utf8.text being in the current directory.

-----------

Note that in gbMembers, the realName column is not obsolete.
New records created have an empty string for a value.
The realName thus is to be ignored. No need to fix it.
