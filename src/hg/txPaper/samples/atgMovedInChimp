     Insulin 2 receptor.  Looks like first codon just not so important
     Downstream a little ways there's a pretty well conserved ATG - most
     mammals and chicken.  This ATG conserved in many 4 or 5 mammals, but many
     lack coverage.

     Has 2 alt promoters.  One consered in mouse, dog, chicken, sequence missing in chimp.
     This one conserved in mouse, platypus, but not chimp, rhesus, bush baby.

     Was chimp start codon in 17-way...  It is a repetive region. Currently just conserved in rhesus.
     It is a gene with alt promoter who's ATG is conserved in chimp, rhesus, rabbit but not dog.
     Gene not there in mouse possum in 17-way.  Reduced species coverage in 25-way, but there 
     and conserved in chimp, rhesus, bush baby..

     Looks like new human start, associated with alt-promoter. ATG associated with other promoter
     is concerved across placental mammals.

     Six isoforms of this gene.  This start codon is UTR in most isoforms.  Is not conserved
     in any species.  A start codon found in 3 of the 6 is conserved across placentals..
     Start codon of other two isoforms also poorly conserved, present only in chimp.

     Extremely poorly conserved gene, though mRNA evidence is abundant and orf is larg (780 bases).
     Duplicated in chimp.  Fascinating gene, in tumor necrosis factor receptor family, that may
     be a *new* human gene that helps prevent cancer.  We do need a few of these considering our
     long lifetime compared to our ancestors.

     Two promoters for this gene.  The ATG for this one is conserved down to platypus except for chimp.
     Chimp qual score is excellent though.  Other promoter is near second exon.  ATG here is conserved
     in chimp and rhesus but not other mammals.  Maybe it's enough to keep chimp alive, or maybe our
     chimp was a mutant here.

     ATG poorly conserved in most mammals, though 17-way and 25-way (but not 28 way) has it in mouse.
     Conservation of first exon is poor.  Conservation picks up in second exon, where there is an ATG
     that is conserved in 13/14 mammals with sequence in region.  Ample RNA evidence and strong Kozak 
     consensus at current human position though.
