# The repeat range in NM_020469.2 mRNA coords is (1-based) 1310 - 1319
# HGVS UTR3 coords are relative to cdsEnd which is 1090 for NM_020469.2.
# Subtracting 1090, the c. coords of the repeat region are (1-based) 220 - 229.
# This actually needs to be shifted right one base because there is a C after all the CACA:
NM_020469.3:c.*229_*230insCA
# This is properly right-shifted on NM_020469.2, so due to strand-swapping it is
# already left-shifted on the genome and does not need to be left-shifted for VCF:
NM_020469.3:c.*230_*231insAC
# But somebody might forego right-alignment on NM_020469.2, meaning we would
# need to left-shift on the genome for VCF:
NM_020469.3:c.*221_*222insCA
NM_020469.3:c.*220_*221insAC
NM_020469.3:c.*219_*220insCA
