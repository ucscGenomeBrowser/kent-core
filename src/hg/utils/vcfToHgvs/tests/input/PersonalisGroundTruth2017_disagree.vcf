# ASH PTV069: The reference genome has a deleted G, so this "variant" means no change to NM_003573.
# Personalis reports c.3125G= instead of c.3125dupG.  I report c.3125_3126= because the variant is
# reported as an insertion.  6 of one, half dozen of the other?

# ASH PTV083: SHANK3 has 42 coding bases that don't map well to the reference assembly, and
# there is a big chunk of genome to skip over so it looks like an intron unless you see the
# double-sided gap lines in the PSL alignments.  Ugh!  We should do better but I think the
# "1307_1309delGTT" is wrong because 1307_1309 is CGA not GTT.  1307 may be mapped to G by
# some aligners but the next two genomic bases (TT deleted) are skipped over in the RefSeq
# alignment, not part of the transcript.

# ASH PTV099: in this case, the older refSeq differed from the reference genome but the
# latest version (NM_000535.6) matches the genome (even though genome allele is minor allele).

# ASH PTV101: Detecting a dup is possible if using genomic sequence -- however, that gives the
# false impression of affecting a splice region, when in the reality the c. effect is an insertion.
# Why not leave the dup-calling to the g. HGVS?  I wonder what the HGVS authors would say here.
# I guess in HGVS c. they don't require it to map directly to functional effect, for example
# keeping a c. change in the correct exon even if it could be 3'-shifted.  Then when computing
# the p. they do seem to want to be consistent with the functional change, so the p. does not
# necessarily correspond to the c.

# ASH PTV106 and PTV107: they have the sophistication to use phased genotypes to combine
