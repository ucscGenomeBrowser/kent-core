<title>&amp;#147;A New Gold Standard for PCs&amp;#148;</title>
<link>http://ptech.wsj.com/archive/solution-20051130.html</link>
<description>For the Wall Street Journal, Walt Mossberg writes, &amp;#147;To put it simply: No desktop offered by Dell or Hewlett-Packard or Sony or Gateway can match the new iMac G5&amp;#146;s combination of power, elegance, simplicity, ease of use, built-in software, stability and security. From setup to performing the most intense tasks, it&amp;#146;s a pleasure to use. And, contrary to common misconceptions, this Mac is competitively priced, when compared with comparably equipped midrange Windows PCs; and it handles all common Windows files, as well as the Internet and email, with aplomb.&amp;#148; [Nov 30, 2005]</description>

<link>http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/nov2005/tc20051118_828982.htm</link>
<description>Stephen Wildstrom writes for BusinessWeek, &amp;#147;Improving an excellent machine was the happy challenge facing Apple Computer (AAPL) designers as they worked up new versions of the iMac G5 desktop.

Though the changes in the new 17-inch ($1,299) and 20-inch ($1,699) iMacs are relatively small, they help keep it atop the heap as the best consumer desktop around.&amp;#148; [Nov 18, 2005]</description>
