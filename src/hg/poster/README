Stuff for making posters and roll-folds for papers on
genomes.  This includes:

foldDb - Creates a tab-separated data file which serves
   as input to Ewan Birney's PostScript generating program.
   This was used for the roll-folds in the draft human genome 
   paper.
foldGfx - An experiment that was never used for making
   graphics directly.
finPoster - Creates a tab-separated data file to send to Ewan
   for the finished human genome paper in 2003.
