Relax "expected overlap" to 90% of expected overlap.

Do a second pass of merging where clone ends are all '?'
except for finished/ordered.

Looking at clone AC011858 - has substantial overlap with
huge NT contig NT_001520.  Still has some sequence with
no overlap (30 kb).
    Hmm, looks like a 20+ kb fragment that doesn't align...


Looking at clone AP000511
     Nice overlap with AB023048 - 125k end to end.  But...
     AB023048 is enclosed in NT_001520 with 100% overlap and
             AP000511/AB023048 overlap has 654 base tail and 
	     3 parts per thousand noise.   
     Map distance ~4 megabase.




Possibly have a second pass that's less strict about tails and noise.

Looking at clone AB014084
