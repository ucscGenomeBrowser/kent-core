1 - Reads in sequence.inf, overlap, and sts files.  Assigns scores to overlaps.
    Joins clone pairs into barges and extends barges by one clone.
2 - Merges barges joined by pairs.
3 - Iterates placement three times at gradually reduced stringency.
    Places enclosed clones.
4 - Last iteration tolerates STS mismatches.
5 - Flip clone offsets when I flip a barge.  (Oops, forgot earlier).
    Made STS positions of merged barges more robust in presence of
    mismatches.  (Still not perfect).
6 - Changed handling of enclosed clones so that hopefully at least
    when you have the situation:
        A -------------------
	B  -------------------
    one of the A/B pair *does* get placed.
    Also STS conflicts in initial barge of two are handled a little better.
7 - Last iteration doesn't tolerate STS mismatches.
