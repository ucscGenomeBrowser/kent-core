<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
Allele-Specific Expression (ASE) is a measurement of the difference of gene expression 
between the two alleles of a gene in a heterozygous individual.  
This difference (also called `allelic imbalance') can be due to many biological processes, 
including presence of cis-regulatory genetic variants, imprinting, and nonsense-mediated decay.</p>   
<p>
This track hub shows summary tracks of ASE identified from transcriptome and
genotype data collected in 53 tissues by the 
<a target="_blank" href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/GTEx/index">Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project</a>, and analyzed by the GTEx Analysis Group
(<a target="_blank" href="http://tllab.org">Lappalainen Lab</a> at the New York Genome Center).</p>

<p>
The GTEx project was initiated by the NIH as a sample and data resource for studies 
on the relationship between genetic variation and gene expression in multiple human tissues.
The data presented here is from the GTEx midpoint milestone data release (V6, October 2015).

For detailed analysis of ASE patterns in GTEx, the full ASE data is available via dbGap.

<h2>Display Conventions</h2>
<p>
The <em>ASE Density</em> track provides a cross-tissue summary of ASE via a density graph
of median allelic imbalance across all tissues in a sliding window.<p>
<p>
The <em>ASE Sites</em> track shows all SNPs with evidence of ASE in any tissue.
Each site is identified by the SNP ID, or if none assigned, then by chromosomal start position.</p>
<p>
The <em>ASE by Tissue</em> track contains a subtrack showing ASE sites for each of the 
53 tissues assayed.
Sites are colored based on the median ASE for the site across all samples of the tissue;
shaded from gray (low) to the GTEx convention tissue color (high) with an intermediate 
color representing moderate ASE level.</p>

<h2>Methods</h2>
<p>
Allelic expression tracks were generated on a per tissue basis. Allelic counts were generated 
at heterozygous variants called from Illumina OMNI 2.5 Array genotyping with imputation using
the GATK ASEReadCounter tool. Only uniquely aligned reads with a base quality of at least 10
at heterozygous sites were used.</p>
<p>
The allelic imbalance value per site (ranged between 0 and 0.5) is the median allelic imbalance
 across individuals with sufficient allelic coverage, calculated as 
|0.5-REF_COUNT/(REF_COUNT+ALT_COUNT)|. Sites with low mappability (ENCODE 50 bp mappability 
score less than 1) or that showed mapping bias in simulations (Panousis et al., 2014) 
were removed.</p>
<p>
The cross-tissue density graph was generated by a sliding window algorithm (window size 10 variants, step of 2 variants).  Only those variants within 10kb of the first variant in the window 
are included.
