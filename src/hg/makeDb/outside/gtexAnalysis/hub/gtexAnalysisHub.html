<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
The
<a target="_blank" href="https://commonfund.nih.gov/GTEx/index">NIH Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEX) project</a>
was created to establish a sample and data resource for studies on the relationship between 
genetic variation and gene expression in multiple human tissues. 
To view the GTEx tissues in anatomical context, see the 
<a target="_blank" href="/gtexBodyMap.html">GTEx Body Map</a>.
This track hub shows tracks of analysis results from the 
GTEx midpoint milestone data release (V6, October 2015).
</P>
<p>
Tracks available from this hub include summary Allele-Specific Expression (ASE), provided by the Lappalainen Lab at the
New York Genome Center (as part of the GTEx Analysis Working Group), and Distant Expression Quantitative Trait Loci (Trans-eQTLs) reported in the
GTEx midpoint release (V6) Nature publication, "Genetic effects on gene expression across human tissues".
Additional analysis tracks will be added as they become available.

<h2>Subject and Sample Characteristics</h2>
<p>
The scientific goal of the GTEx project required that the donors and their biospecimen 
present with no evidence of disease. 
The tissue types collected were chosen based on their clinical significance, logistical 
feasibility and their relevance to the scientific goal of the project and the 
research community. 
Postmortem samples were collected from non-diseased donors with ages ranging from 20 to 79. 34.4% of donors were female and 65.6% male.

<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>
Samples were collected by the GTEx Consortium.
RNA-seq and genotyping were performed by the GTEx Laboratory, Data Analysis and Coordinating Center 
(LDACC) at the Broad Institute.
Further analyses were performed by members of the GTEx Analysis Working Group (see each track for credits).
The UCSC Genome Browser group post-processed the analysis files and created this track hub.
