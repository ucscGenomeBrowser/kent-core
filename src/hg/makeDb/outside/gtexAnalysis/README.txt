This directory hosts build tools and generated files (under source control) for the
GTEx Analysis hub.  The first analysis dataset, on which this hub is based
is Allele-Specific Expression, from NY Genome Center.

Subdirs and files are:
    buildNotes.*.txt    Process for building hub
    hub/                Source controlled version of hub configuration files

The hub is here:
