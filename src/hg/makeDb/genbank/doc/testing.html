    <H1>GenBank/RefSeq Update Testing</H1>
    There is currently no automated test suite for the GenBank update process.
    Due to dependency on a large amount of external data, this is going to be a
    bit tricky to implement. Currently a set of tools and procedures is used to
    assist with testing. 

    <H3>Test programs and scripts</H3>

    <UL>
      <LI><CODE>gbIndexTest</CODE> - Program to load and dump parts of the the
      index files. Useful for testing the loading code and verifying the
      contents of the index.</LI>

      <LI><CODE>gbGetTestSubset</CODE> - Generate a subset download area for
      testing. This requires a full download and a completed process step. This
      extracts a small subset for testing the alignment and database loading
      steps. List of extracted accessions can be saved for one release and then
      used as extra access to extract from another release. This can then be
      used for psl migration testing.</LI>

      <LI><CODE>dump-test-tables</CODE> - Script to dump tables from a test
      database in a form that can be diffed.</LI>
    </UL>

    <H3>Testing methodology</H3>

    <UL>
      <LI>To aid in test incremental processing, update directories that are
      not readable will be skipped. This allows changing view of what is
      available for processing with <CODE>chmod</CODE> rather than moving
      directories.</LI>
