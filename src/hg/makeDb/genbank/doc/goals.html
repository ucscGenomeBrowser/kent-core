    <H1>GenBank/RefSeq Update Goals</H1>

    <UL>
      <LI>Incremental update of mRNAs and ESTs for multiple species and
      assemblies based on daily updates from NCBI.</LI>

      <LI>Automatically run from cron, possibly every night.</LI>

      <LI>Only require manual intervention on non-recoverable errors or when a
      large cluster run is required to do a large alignment.</LI>

      <LI>Incremental across GenBank releases; don't force a full realignment
      every quarter.</LI>

      <LI>Allow removal of older genbank full releases (and still not force a
      full realignment).</LI>

      <LI>Avoid corruption of disk files and databases.</LI>

      <LI>Recover from failures state, automatically when possible, making
      manual recover easy.</LI>

      <LI>Allow restarting failed steps without restarting the entire
      process.</LI>

      <LI>Don't require the process to be run at defined intervals. When a run
      is done, data files will be updated to reflect the current state of the
      NCBI repository.</LI>

      <LI>Include HTS files in automated download process.</LI>
