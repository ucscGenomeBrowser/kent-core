    <H1>Configuring <CODE>ssh</CODE> for GenBank Alignments</H1>
    <P>Due to the fact that <CODE>rsh</CODE> does not return the exit
    code of the remote process, <CODE>ssh</CODE> is used to run remote
    processes.  In order for this to run unattended, 
    <CODE>ssh</CODE> must be configured to run without prompting for
    a password.  Authentication of <CODE>ssh</CODE> with <CODE>.rhosts</CODE>
    is not enabled at UCSC, so setting up a no passphrase key is the easiest
    way to achieve this.
    <OL>
      <LI> Generate a key without a passphrase.
      <PRE>
      ssh-keygen -t dsa -f ~/.ssh/nokey_dsa -N ''
      </PRE>

      <LI>Copy the contents on <CODE>.ssh/nokey_dsa.pub</CODE> to
         <CODE>.ssh/authorized_keys</CODE>.

      <LI>Modify <CODE>.ssh/config</CODE> to specify using this identity
          file:
      <PRE>
      Host *
              IdentityFile ~/.ssh/nokey_dsa
              IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_dsa
      </PRE>
      <LI> Verify that you can ssh from <CODE>eieio</CODE> to <CODE>kk</CODE>
           and the iservers.
           If you are using <CODE>ssh-agent</CODE>, exit it before testing.
      <PRE>
      foreach h (kk kkr1u00 kkr2u00 kkr3u00 kkr4u00 kkr5u00 kkr6u00 kkr7u00 kkr8u00)
         ssh $h uname -a
      end
      </PRE>
      <LI>If you have never ssh-ed to a machine before, you will be prompted
          the first time to add it to your ~/.ssh/known_hosts file.  If you
          have ssh-ed to a machine, but the host key has changed (often
          happens on an OS update), then you must edit ~/.ssh/known_hosts to
          remove the remote host entry, then repeat the ssh to add the host
          under the new host key.  Don't start the alignments until you can
          ssh to kk and the iservers without being prompted.


      <LI> If you have started an alignment and discover that the
          <CODE>ssh</CODE> is not working correctly, fix the
          problem and restart <CODE>gbAlignStep</CODE> process
          by adding the <CODE>-continue=copy</CODE> option.  This
          restarts that process at the point of copying the files
          to the <CODE>iservers</CODE>.  All other options will be
          the same.
