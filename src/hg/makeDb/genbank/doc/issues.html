    <H1>GenBank/RefSeq Annoying Issues</H1>

    <UL>
      <LI>The entire GenBank directory is replace when a new version is
      release. Daily releases are relative to this.</LI>

      <LI>GenBank daily release don't indicate deleted entries.</LI>

      <LI>GenBank daily filenames don't include a year, so daily files between
      the beginning of the year and next release (probably Jan 15th) will not
      sort in a simple manner.</LI>

      <LI>RefSeq updates it cumulative files daily as well as having separate
      daily files. There is no concept of a release.</LI>

      <LI>RefSeq deleted entries are still in the older daily releases. There
      no daily records indicating when an entry has been deleted.</LI>

      <LI>Ocassionally, there are incorrect genbank entries that break
      assumptions in this code. These are skipped by placing them an
      <CODE>data/ignore.idx</CODE> acc.</LI>

      <LI>MySql ISAM tables don't support foreign keys. Using
      <CODE>auto_increment</CODE> for id columns was a problems because
      <CODE>mysqlimport</CODE> would reset the numbers (or at least not insert
      zero).</LI>

      <LI>Want to use disk files rather than a database to track genbank
      repository files. This is faster when we need to look at all entries and
      makes setup and loading multiple database servers easier. It was also
      easier to implement. However this proved to be a problem for ESTs, which
      require large amount of memory to handle. To reduce the memory required,
      ESTs are partitioned by the first two letters of the accession.</LI>

      <LI> Don't handle realigning sequences (say to take advantage of
      changes to the aligner).
