    <H1>GenBank/RefSeq Update Deployment</H1>
    This page describes how the GenBank/RefSeq update process is deployed. <BR>
    <BR>
    <EM>This is a proposed setup, not currently implemented. The following
    system setup is required:</EM> 

    <OL>
      <LI>Create a user <CODE>genbank</CODE> on the cluster, and the
      round-robin and GBDB server (<CODE>hgnfs1</CODE>).
      Enable <CODE>sudo</CODE> to <CODE>genbank</CODE> for
      <CODE>markd</CODE>.</LI>

      <LI>There is currently sufficient disk space on
      <CODE>/cluster/store5/</CODE> for GenBank files and alignments for human,
      mouse and rat. However diskspace should be monitored and may need to be
      increased.</LI>

      <LI>Setup an rsync server on <CODE>eieio</CODE> accessable from
      the GBDB server.

      <LI>Setup the <CODE><EM>/somewhere</EM>/genbank/</CODE> directory on the
      GBDB server, owned by <CODE>genbank</CODE>, preferably on the same
      filesytems as <CODE>/gbdb/</CODE> (but not under <CODE>/gbdb/</CODE>).
      NFS export and mount on the round-robin servers as
      <CODE>/genbank/</CODE>. I should also available as
      <CODE>/genbank/</CODE> on the GBDB server as well.</LI>
    </OL>

    <H3>Download/Processing/Alignment (build)</H3>

    <UL>
      <LI>These three steps are collectively know as the <EM>build</EM>
      phase.</LI>

      <LI>The <EM>GenBank root</EM> directory is currently at:<BR>
       <CODE>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/cluster/store5/genbank/</CODE></LI>

      <LI>
        Estimates of disk space requirements: 

        <UL>
          <LI><A href="download-step.html#dir"><CODE>download/</CODE></A> -
          50-75gb, depending on how many previous release are maintained. Once
          a new release is downloaded and processed (quarterly), old downloaded
          files can be archived.</LI>

          <LI><A href=
          "data-processing-step.html#dir"><CODE>processed/</CODE></A> - 25-50gb
          - processed files must be maintained as long as some database is
          using sequences from them.</LI>

          <LI><A href="alignment-step.html#dir"><CODE>aligned/</CODE></A> -
          ~3gb per release per genome assembly</LI>

          <LI>Cluster accessable, temporary work space - ~2gb,</LI>
        </UL>
        Note that these replace data currently kept in other locations, however
        the downloads it now include the HTG sequences, which add several
        gigabytes of data.
      </LI>

      <LI>
        The download, processing, and alignment steps run on the <EM>GenBank
        build server</EM>, which should have the following attributes: 

        <UL>
          <LI>Should have the <EM>GenBank root</EM> directories as local
          filesystem.</LI>

          <LI>Should have at least two CPUs.</LI>

          <LI>Must be able to <CODE>rsh</CODE> to <CODE>kkr1u00</CODE> and
          <CODE>kk</CODE>.</LI>
        </UL>
        <CODE>kkstore</CODE> is probably the best candidate.
      </LI>

      <LI>A dedicated user, <CODE>genbank</CODE>, allows multiple people to
      manage the jobs.</LI>

      <LI>A cron job will start the process daily at 1am.</LI>
    </UL>

    <H3>Round-Robin Database Update</H3>

    <UL>
      <LI>
        In order to update the databases on the round-robin servers, each
        server must have acecss to the <CODE>processed/</CODE> and
        <CODE>aligned/</CODE> directories. FASTA files under the
        <CODE>processed/</CODE> directory must be copied into the
        <CODE>/gbdb/genbank/</CODE> directory. Since these directories are
        large, they are maintained on the <EM>GBDB server</EM> for access by
        the round-robin servers. 

        <UL>
          <LI>The <EM>GBDB server</EM> exports a <CODE>/genbank/</CODE>
          directory to the the round-robin servers, which contains the
          <CODE>processed/</CODE> and <CODE>aligned/</CODE> directories.</LI>

          <LI>If possible, the <CODE>/gbdb/</CODE> and <CODE>/genbank/</CODE>
          directories should be on the same physical file system on the GBDB
          server. This way, the FASTA file under the <CODE>/gbdb/</CODE>
          directory can be hard links to the ones under the
          <CODE>processed/</CODE> directory, saving significant disk space. If
          this is not possible, the FASTA files will be copied.</LI>
        </UL>
      </LI>

      <LI>A process running on the GBDB server must be able to <CODE>rsync</CODE>
      files from the <EM>GenBank root</EM>. on the cluster</LI>

      <LI>
        A cron job <EM>GBDB server</EM> polls (with rsync) the <EM>GenBank build server</EM>
        to determine if new alignments are ready. 

        <UL>
          <LI>Copy new <CODE>processed/</CODE> and <CODE>aligned/</CODE> files
          to <CODE>/genbank/</CODE> hierarchy, in to passed, one to get the
          data files, and a second to get the index files.</LI>

          <LI>Update the <CODE>/gbdb/genbank/</CODE> hierarchy with the new
          FASTA files.  If <CODE>/genbank/</CODE> and <CODE>/gbdb/</CODE>
          are the same file system, these will be hardlinks.</LI>

          <LI>Flag copy as complete.</LI>
        </UL>
      </LI>

      <LI>
        The each <EM>round-robin server</EM> periodically examines the the
        <CODE>/genbank/</CODE> to see if a copy has completed. 

        <UL>
          <LI>Run the <A href="database-update-step.html">database update
          step</A> to update tables the tables.</LI>

          <LI>Run <CODE>gbSanity</CODE> to verify the update.</LI>
