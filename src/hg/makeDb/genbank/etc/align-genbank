# genbank-build, however it can be run by hand if the alignment needs to
# be manually completed.  Edit this file to add new genomes and assemblies.
#
# -copy - continue a file alignment at the copy phase
# -finish - Finish processing an alignment that was completed by hand.
# -workdir dir - set the workdir, need with -finish if the date has
#  changed since the alignment was started.
# -keep - don't delete working directory
