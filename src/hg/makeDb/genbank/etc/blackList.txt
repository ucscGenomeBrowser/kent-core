# These accessions represent viral and viral-associated miRNAs.  In
# general, they are not products of eukaryotic genomes, but given their
# small sizes, many of them align well to eukaryotic genomes by chance.
# Consequently, we cannot filter out many of these sequences based on
# alignment heuristics alone.
