# the Chinese Trio headers are incorrect, and say "INTEGRATION"
# instead of the sample name, reheader those:
for db in hg38 hg19; do
    pushd ${db}/ChineseTrio
    for parent in HG006 HG007; do
        echo ${parent} | bcftools reheader -s - ${parent}*.vcf.gz -o ${parent}.vcf.gz
        tabix -p vcf ${parent}.vcf.gz
    done
    popd
done

# now merge all the different samples together for each trio:
./mergeVcfs.sh
