# udHistory.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated udHistory.c and udHistory.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Records alterations made to ultra database
CREATE TABLE udHistory (
    who varchar(255) not null,	# Name of user who made change
    program varchar(255) not null,	# Name of program that made change
    time varchar(255) not null,	# When alteration was made
