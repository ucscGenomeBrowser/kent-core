alignToPsl creates a psl file from a pairwise alignment.  
It has options to add a given fixed size of the sequence 
(if the sequence present is only part of a bigger sequence), 
as well as beginning offsets.  These two options make sense 
if the alignment is of coordinates 10-20 in a sequence which 
has an actual size of 1000.
