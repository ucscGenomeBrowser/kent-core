- input/base.psl - basic test set:
    - some alignments with CDS partially or fully outside of alignment
    - ENSMUST00000135223.1 CDS is truncated at end, but CDS was created by
      a program that didn't indicate start/end status.  Was 1..718, should be
      have been 1..>718.

- input/badCdsMm4.psl - regression
   - mm4.mgcGenes had 2 records with cdsEnd < cdsStart :

    BC048391 | chr4_random | -      | 10613545 | 10675926 | 10675837 | 10614419
    BC055102 | chr5_random | -      | 17730242 | 17786884 | 17786731 | 17730418

  this was caused by code not getting the CDS right when on the negative
  strand when the CDS start or end positions didn't align.
