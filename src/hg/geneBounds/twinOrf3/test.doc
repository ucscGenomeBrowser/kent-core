Experiments in mouse-homology assisted ORF finder.

74.2% refSeq Results using 2nd order markov for UTRs, 
                   simple codon-at-a-time model for coding,
		   0th order markov for Kozak and ad-hoc
		   penalty of 0.1 per base of UTRs.
69.9% refSeq2 Results using 3rd order DNA markovs for UTRs
                   and for each of 3 codon positions,  1st order
		   Markov for Kozak (including 1st two bases of 2nd
		   codon).
72.4% refSeq_3 -   Added 3rd order markov at end of stop codon rather
                   than requiring just tag,taa or tga in target sequence.
79.6% refSeq_4 -   Penalizing utrs 0.1 per base.  (Pretty arbitrary

85.10% refSeq_26 -   Bonus of 17 to first ATG and 17 to first UNNATG. UTR penalty 0.15
84.96% refSeq_27 - Bonuses like refSeq_24. 1st 10 amino acids not in coding model.
81.88% refSeq_28 - Separate model for 1st 10 amino acids and rest. 
85.09% refSeq_29 - Separate model but using same tables for beginning and end.
