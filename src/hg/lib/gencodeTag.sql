# gencodeTag.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated gencodeTag.c and gencodeTag.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Tags associated with GENCODE transcripts.

    index(transcriptId),
