# gencodeToRefSeq.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated gencodeToRefSeq.c and gencodeToRefSeq.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#GENCODE transcript to RefSeq mRNA or non-coding RNA and peptide accession mapping
