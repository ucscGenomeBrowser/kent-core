# asmAlias.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated asmAlias.c and asmAlias.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#correspondence of assembly identifiers to UCSC database or GenArk hub equivalents
CREATE TABLE asmAlias (
    alias varchar(255) not null,	# external assembly name
    browser varchar(255) not null,	# UCSC genome browser equivalent
              #Indices
    PRIMARY KEY(alias)
