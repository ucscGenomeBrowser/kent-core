# gencodeAnnotationRemark.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated gencodeAnnotationRemark.c and gencodeAnnotationRemark.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

    remark longblob not null,	# Comment by annotator
