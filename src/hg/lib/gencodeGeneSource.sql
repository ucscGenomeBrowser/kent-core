# gencodeGeneSource.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated gencodeGeneSource.c and gencodeGeneSource.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#The source of Gencode gene annotation
