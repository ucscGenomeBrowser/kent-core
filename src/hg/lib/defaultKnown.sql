# defaultKnown.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated defaultKnown.c and defaultKnown.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Name of database with knownGene tables
CREATE TABLE defaultKnown (
    name varchar(255) not null,	# Name of database with knownGene tables
              #Indices
    PRIMARY KEY(name)
);
