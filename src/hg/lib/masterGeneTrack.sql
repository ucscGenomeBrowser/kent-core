# masterGeneTrack.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated masterGeneTrack.c and masterGeneTrack.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Name of default gene track in database
CREATE TABLE masterGeneTrack (
    name varchar(255) not null,	# Name of default gene track in database
              #Indices
