# defaultCart.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated defaultCart.c and defaultCart.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#The default cart
CREATE TABLE defaultCart (
    contents longblob not null	# cart contents
