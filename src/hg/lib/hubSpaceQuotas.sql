# hubSpaceQuotas.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated hubSpaceQuotas.c and hubSpaceQuotas.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Table for per-user quotas that differ from the default quota
CREATE TABLE hubSpaceQuotas (
    userName varchar(255) not null,	# userName in gbMembers
    quota bigint not null,	# the users quota
              #Indices
    PRIMARY KEY(userName)
);
