gbToFaRa reads one or more GenBank format files and a filter file as input. 
It then ouputs the GenBank data into a set of fasta .fa files and .ra 
(rna annotations) files. It also outputs a .ta file containing summary statistics.
Additionally, it has an option called "-byOrganism=" that makes the program 
create a separate ouput directory for each organism for which it writes out data.
The .fa and .ra files are then placed in each respective organism's subdirectory under
the directory specified as the argument to the "-byOrganism=" option.

The filter file format is documented below. It serves the purpose of 
filtering the GenBank input so only the desired kinds of data are
written out.

Filter file format:
        There are 4 kinds of lines that start with one of the following keywords:

1) 'restrict' lines.  These are followed by an expression.
     If the expression evaluates to TRUE then the record
     is copied to the output .fa and .ra files.
2) 'hide' lines.  These list the fields to suppress in the output .ra
     file.
3) 'type' lines.  If present and followed by the word 'BAC' the
     software tries to parse draft clones into contigs.  This has
     not been tested for quite some time, and probably no
     longer works.
4) '//' lines - these are comments.

The restrict and hide lines can refer to the following fields:
     org - Organism.   Example "Homo sapiens"
     siz - Size of sequence in bases.
     acc - Genbank accession.  Example "AC100002"
     ver - Version of sequence in Genbank.  Typically a small number"
     def - Definition.  A one sentence description of sequence usually.
     src - Source of sequence.  Often similar to 'org'
     key - Search keywords for sequence.  HTG is a frequent one for large projects
     aut - Author.  People who submitted sequence.
     dat - Date submitted to Genbank.  Example "2001-07-02"
     mol - Molecule.  Typically 'mRNA' or 'DNA'
     cat - Genbank Category.  Examples 'PRI' for primate, 'ROD' for rodent.
     cur - True if sequence manually curated.
     dir - direction of ESTs:  5' or 3'
     pha - Phase of sequence: 3 is finished, 2 is ordered, 1 is unordered, 0 is predraft
     cen - Sequencing center.  'Sanger', 'WashU', 'Whitehead' etc.
     cel - Cell type.
     dev - developmental stage
     sex - male, female, etc.
     tis - tissue
     lib - library
     clo - clone name
     chr - chromosome (not usually very accurate)
     map - map field.
     cds - boundaries of coding portion
     gen - gene name
     pro - protein product name

Example:

// This writes out only RNA molecule data for the Homo Sapiens organism.
// It hides the acutal RNA data in the ouput file.
restrict mol=mRNA & org="Homo sapiens"
hide mol
