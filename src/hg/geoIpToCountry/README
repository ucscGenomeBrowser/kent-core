Creating a utility to lookup country via IP address using our existing geoIp infrastructure,
including the geoIp.geoIpCountry6 table which has been pushed to hgcentraltest.
This should not be required to push geoIpCountry6 table to the RR unless people want to run this utility there.

Hiram is interested in processing log files and looking up country via IP.
In particular, China blocks google entirely which is a problem.

See the process that builds the geoIp tables and data is in kent/src/hg/geoIp/

I leave it to others to extend this utility to process a list instead of just a commandline option.

Or handle host lookups you can see an example in kent/src/utils/dnsInfo/dnsInfo.c
