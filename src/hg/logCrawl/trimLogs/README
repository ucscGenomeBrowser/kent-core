This directory is for the various scripts used to parse only the trackLog
lines out of an apache error_log and collate the various trackLog N lines
together.

The output of this is used by various other scripts like
dbTrackAndSearchUsage/generateSearchUse.py

Typically this would be run as a cronjob:
43 9 * * mon /path/to/script/runTrimLogs.sh -t
