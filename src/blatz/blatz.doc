Blatz is a program for aligning nucleic acid sequences
from different species.  At the default settings it
is slower but more sensitive than blastz.  It is much
slower and much more sensitive than blat.  Like blat
blatz can be run as client/server programs useful for
interactive use, or in a standalone program useful for
bulk sequence alignment.

Blatz treats lower-case sequence as repeating elements.
It will not initiate alignments in lower-case regions,
though it will extend alignments that start in upper-case
regions into the lower-case regions.  Generally blatz
will run much faster on sequence that is lower-case masked
than on pure upper case sequence.  (When run on pure
lower case sequence it will not return any results at all.)

Thanks to Webb Miller and the other authors of blastz
for helpful ideas and feedback.
