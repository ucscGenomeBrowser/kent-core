These are the basic steps of the blatz algorithm.

* - Make index of query sequences using gapped seeds.
* - Scan index, doing gapless extension of hits into MSPs, and
    keeping list of MSPs scoring over minGapless threshold.
* - Chain MSPs using very light gap penalties, drop chains below 
    minChain threshold.
* - Do banded extensions off of ends of MSPs in chains.  
* - Chain blocks using regular gap penalties.
* - Expand into remaining gaps by building a finer-grained index
    covering the gap, and repeating process with this index.
* - Output chains scoring over minScore.
