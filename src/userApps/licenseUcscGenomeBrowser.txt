Obtaining a Commercial License for the Genome Browser
        
A license is required for commercial download and/or installation of
the Genome Browser binaries and source code. No license is needed for
academic, nonprofit, and personal use. The data displayed by the browser
is freely available for both public and commercial use with a few exceptions.
The README.txt file in the download directory of each assembly shows the use 
restrictions pertaining to that data set.

To purchase a license:

Read and sign the licensing agreement.  (GenomeBrowserLicense.pdf)
Email a signed copy of the license agreement to
    William Hale, Office for IP Management: whale3@ucsc.edu.

Follow the instructions in the license agreement for submitting
    the signed original copy and payment.

After your license application has been processed, you will receive
instructions for downloading the browser software and data. CDs are
also available upon request.

Genome Browser licensing inquiries should be made
to genome-www@soe.ucsc.edu. For information about commercial licensing of Blat,
