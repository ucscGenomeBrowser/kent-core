Brian Raney says:

At some point we need to take htslib out of the tree.
The stock library supports hooks for the low level file i/o routines so we
can add just a little code to use UDC rather than UNIX file i/o.



HTSlib is an implementation of a unified C library for accessing common file
formats, such as SAM, CRAM, VCF, and BCF, used for high-throughput sequencing
data.  It is the core library used by samtools and bcftools.

See INSTALL for building and installation instructions.
