The two HTML files mirror.html and mirrorManual.html in ../htdocs/goldenPath/help
are generated from the two text files in this directory:

 README.txt -> ../hg/htdocs/goldenPath/help/mirror.html
 mirrorManual.txt -> ../hg/htdocs/goldenPath/help/mirrorManual.html

This makes it possible that installation instructions are normal text files because 
many sys-admin users expect them to be raw ASCII and this is the way we used
to provide them. At the same time, we have nice HTML files for interactive users
and search engines.

Therefore, to modify these files, edit only README.txt and mirrorManual.txt, never
edit the HTML files. Then, run "make" in mirrorDocs/ and follow the instructions.
