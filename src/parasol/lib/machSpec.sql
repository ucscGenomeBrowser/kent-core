# machSpec.sql was originally generated by the autoSql program, which also 
# generated machSpec.c and machSpec.h.  This creates the database representation of
# an object which can be loaded and saved from RAM in a fairly 
# automatic way.

#Basic info about a machine
CREATE TABLE machSpec (
    name varchar(255) not null,	# Network name
