The default license of this repository is the MIT License, but LICENSE files in
subdirectories override the text of this LICENSE file.

Therefore the code in this repository falls into three different license types:

1 the default MIT license (attached below) for code in src/ and most subdirectories
  - this directory includes all code to build and use tools and libraries to
    read and write the Genome Browser file formats, like bigBed and bigWig, and
    the command line tools for these, bedToBigBed, wigToBigWig and the tagStorm
    tools and the parasol job scheduler.
  - also, third-party code from open-source projects bundled for convenience,
    in src/htslib (MIT), and ./src/optimalLeaf (public domain, with attribution).
  - the directories src/hg/autoSql and src/hg/autoXml have MIT LICENSE files, so they are also 
    under the MIT License
2 A non-commercial license from UC for the genome browser website code in
  src/hg/ and subdirectories (see src/hg/LICENSE), see https://genome-store.ucsc.edu/
3 A non-commercial license from Kent Informatics for the BLAT code in src/blat/ and
  src/jkOwnLib/, see http://www.kentinformatics.com/

See https://genome.ucsc.edu/license/ for more details and on how to obtain a license.
