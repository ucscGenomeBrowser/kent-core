Investigation Title	Drop-Seq analysis of  P17 FACS sorted retinal cells from the Tg(Chx10-EGFP/cre,-ALPP)2Clc or Vsx2-GFP transgenic line	
Comment[Submitted Name]	Drop-Seq analysis of  P17 FACS sorted retinal cells from the Tg(Chx10-EGFP/cre,-ALPP)2Clc or Vsx2-GFP transgenic line
Experiment Description	Vsx2-GFP mouse retinas were dissected, FACS sorted for GFP+ cells and single-cell mRNAseq libraries generated with Drop-Seq Drop-Seq was performed on two different batches. Bipolar1-Bipolar4 are replicates from batch 1 and Bipolar5-6 are replicates from Batch 2
