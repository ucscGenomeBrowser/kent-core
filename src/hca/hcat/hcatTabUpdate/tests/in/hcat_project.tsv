HumanLymphoMyeloidProgenitorCells	suitable	"Single Cell RNA sequencing analysis of human haemopoietic lympho-myeloid progenitor populations (LMPP, MLP and GMP)"	5	Gottgens	already openly published	suitable	import GEO	GSE100618	/uploads/project/GSE100618.tsv	"We performed single cell RNA sequencing of human haemopoietic lympho-myeloid progenitors with the aim to separate functionally and transcriptionally distinct progenitors within the heterogeneous GMP, LMPP and MLP populations. We performed RNA sequencing in a total of 415 single cells. From donors 1 (CB369) and 2 (CB431), 163/166 and 157/249 cells passed quality control.We further analysed the 320 single cells that passed quality control from two  different donors (157 and 163 from each donor; 91 LMPP, 110 MLP and 119 GMP). We performed clustering using Seurat package, which identified 3 clusters of cells.  We identified genes that were differentially expressed among cells of the different clusters. The majority of the cells in cluster 1 were MLP, the majority of cluster 3 were GMP while cluster comprised of LMPP and GMP cells. Cluster 1 showed high expression of lymphoid-affiliated genes. Conversely, cluster 3 showed increased expression of myeloid genes, while cluster 2 showed a mixed transcriptional signature. PCA analysis revealed a transcriptional continuum of LMPP, MLP and GMP populations."
