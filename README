There are short descriptions for most tools here:
http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/linux.x86_64/FOOTER.txt

Here are some selected tools that are useful:

bedToBigBed - create a bigBed file for rectangle-shaped annotations (genes, enhancers, promoters, etc)
bigBedToBed - the inverse of bedToBigBed
bigBedInfo - Show information about a bigBed file. Can extract .autoSql field definitions.

wigToBigWig - create a bigWig file for signal (barchart) annotations from a .wig file
bigWigToWig - the inverse of wigToBigWig
bigWigInfo - show information about bigWig files


bedGraphToBigWig - as above, but for a .bed (bedgraph) file
bamToPsl - create a PSL file given a BAM file
bedToPsl - same, but for BED files
bedClip - restrict BED features to the chrom boundaries
bedCoverage - Analyse coverage by bed files
bedItemOverlapCount - count number of times a base is overlapped by the items in a bed file.
bedSort - sort a BED file in memory, easier in pipes than Unix sort
bedExons - break BED file into exons
bigBedNamedItems - Extract item of given name from bigBed
bigHeat - given a single BED file and a matrix with one row per feature, create a heatmap-like display
bigWigCat - merge non-overlapping bigWig files directly into bigWig format
bigWigCluster - Cluster bigWigs using a hacTree
binFromRange - Translate a 0-based half open start and end into a bin range sql expression.
chainFilter - Filter chain files.  
chainSort - Sort chains. 
chainToPsl - Convert chain file to psl format
chopFaLines - pretty print FA files with shorter lines
chromToUcsc - change NCBI or Ensembl chromosome names to UCSC names in tabular or wiggle files, using a chromAlias table.
faAlign - Align two fasta files
faCount - count base statistics and CpGs in FA files.
faFilter - Filter fa records, selecting ones that match the specified conditions
faRc - Reverse complement a FA file
